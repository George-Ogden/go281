        This is some of my research.
        I used to try to use the previous article as the quality benchmark for the next one (so they get progressively better).
        I also used try to write moderately frequently (which may conflict with the previous goal).
        Either way, this was just the tip of the iceberg of what I was working on.
        I don't expect to publish research in this way anymore.
